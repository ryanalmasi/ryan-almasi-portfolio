# Ryan Almasi Personal Website

This is a personal website I created in order to store and display who I am as well as my personal accomplishments. The entirety of this website was made purely using ReactJS as well as NodeJS. This is the current completed build, however, many changes are to come as I begin to find more time within the near future. Stay tuned as I am excited for what's in store! This website was created within the span of 3 full dyas, beginning on January 14th.
